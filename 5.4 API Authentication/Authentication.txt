API Authentication levels

0. No Authentication (PUBLIC APIs)
Sometimes when API is used by many unknown users, there is no Authentication but a limit on the usage, like: API requests are rate limited to 100 requests every 15 minutes.

1. Basic Authentication 
When you make API request, you provide your Username & Password, to prove your identity, this is done using Base64 Encoding
Eg: username:password --> XXXXXXXXXXXX (Base64 Encoding)
Eg: vanshsikka:12221223 --> dmFuc2hzaWtrYToxMjIyMTIyMw== (Encoded)

2. API Key Authorization
Generating a key using a particulae endpoint.

3. Token Based Authentication/ OOATH (Most Secure) and mostly used
After logging in using username & password, the API token is generated, which provides additional security, token is used to interact with the API
